# platformer-game-level
A quick platformer game level made in JavasScript using the p5.js library.

Based on the platformer game-making tutorial by [PothOnProgramming on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdS3ojA8RL8t1r18Gj1cl6w).

Implemented the same program structure and management while incorporating it with p5.js to make some things easier and more intuitive (as when compared to VanillaJS).
